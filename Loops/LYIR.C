Definition of leap year:
------------------------
Rule 1: 
-------
A year is called leap year if it is divisible by 400.
For example:
------------
1600, 2000 etc leap year while 1500, 1700 are not leap year.

Rule 2: 
-------
If year is not divisible by 400 as well as 100 but it is divisible by 4 then that year are also leap year.
For example:
------------
2004, 2008, 1012 are leap year.


Leap year logic or Algorithm of leap year or Condition for leap year:
---------------------------------------------------------------------
IF year MODULER 400 IS 0
 THEN leap_year
ELSE IF year MODULER 100 IS 0
 THEN not_leap_year
ELSE IF year MODULER 4 IS 0
 THEN leap_year
ELSE
 not_leap_year
